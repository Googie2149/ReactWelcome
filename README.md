# ReactWelcome
Simple reaction entry + greeting bot

## Setup
Clone the repository somewhere  
Run `run.sh`  
It should generate a config blank config file and exit  
Insert your token and other IDs in there, run the script again.  

This bot is barebones intentionally; it's just supposed to cover the gaps where other reaction entry bots may not have single option this offers.
